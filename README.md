# ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project! ðŸš€
I recently completed a comprehensive mobile sales data dashboard using Microsoft Power BI. This project was an incredible learning experience and has enhanced my data visualization skills.
ðŸŒŸ Key Features of the Dashboard:
Total Sales: 308M
Total Quantity: 8K
Transactions: 2K
Average Sales: 41K
ðŸ“Š Dashboard Highlights:
Total Sales by City: A geographical representation of our sales distribution.
Sum of Units Sold by Month and Day: A line chart showing daily sales trends over two months.
Total Sales by Mobile Model: A bar chart comparing sales of different mobile models (iPhone SE, Galaxy S21, OnePlus Nord).
Transactions by Payment Method: A pie chart illustrating the distribution of payment methods (Credit Card, UPI, Debit Card, Cash).
Count of Customer Name by Customer Ratings: A horizontal bar chart displaying customer ratings distribution.
This project has truly shown me the power of data-driven decision-making
